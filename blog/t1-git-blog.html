  <h1>Gitting the hang of version control</h1>
  <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      This week we learned about the command line and version control using Git and Github.
    </p>
    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>
        Version control is the process of incrementally taking snapshots of your project and saving them as checkpoints for later. This allows for developers to tweak their code and go back to previous versions of it should anything go wrong.
    </p>
    <h2>Git & Github</h2>
    <p>
        Git is a commonly used version control software. Through the power of the command line and Git, developers can quickly and easily manage their projects. Git allows for version control, as well as making feature branches. Feature branches are copy of the main(mater) branch on which developers can test new features before merging them back into the master branch.
        While git alone only stores local copies of your files, Github is a place to store you repositories on the cloud. Github is a website which works along with Git and allows you to store a copy of your project online, as well as other handy collaboration tools. This allows for a streamlined work-flow between multiple developers.
        With Github each commit is cleanly tracked along important information such as comments about the code, what exactly was modified, by who, and at what time.
