    	So far in my Ruby programming I've been mostly using the buuilt in methods on differnt objects in Ruby, this week we learned about how to create our own classes with their own unqiye methods. With this new strategy, we are able to create our own objects, and define different methods with which we can manipulate them.

      In the code above, I created a simple class called "Character", which is initialized with a name, type, and a few levels. These are stored as instance variables. As opposed to local variables which are only available within the method they are defined in, instance variables start with @ and are bound to each particular instance of a class. You can see an example of this in the level_magic method, in which I increment an instance variable defined earlier.
      <br>

      By creating classes, I can create as many new Characters as I wish, each with their own unique attributes, which can be manipulated using the methods defined within their class. There's always room for expansion and adding more methods for increased functionality.
