      Shereef's <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat </a> exposed me to a lot more about the unique culture which initially drew me towards DBC.

    <p>
      Dev Bootcamp doesn't give grades, they don't care how much or little you know coming in, all that matters is your passion to code and develop. It's nothing like traditional schooling, and there's strong focus on self development and empathy. At DBC nothing is promised, you get out what you put in, and we're all seen as chefs in a kitchen. Working together, sharing recipes, taste testing, and creating a great dish together is what DBC is all about. The emphasis on well roundedness ensures that no one will be leaving here a mere code monkey, but a true developer with the passion to always be learning.

      I'm extremely excited to flourish in this unique environment while learning more about myself and development that ever before.
