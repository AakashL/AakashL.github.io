      Who would have guessed that one simple acronym could help give more effective feedback. All it takes it feedback that's Actionable, Specific, and Kind. DBC has taught me that making sure to hit each of these points will result in great feedback that will benefit the fedbackee.

      It's amazing how much more effective pairing sessions can be than going solo. It really gives me a chance to see what I truly know, what I could improve on, and I always leave learning at least 1 new trick or skill from my pair. Having to articulate my thoughts and explain exactly what's in my mind is gives me a great indicator of where I am with the martial. It's frustrating at times when I can't express my ideas as well as I want , but this helps me brush up on my understanding and technical jargon. I've found all of my pairs to be pleasant, even if I was a bit stuck or something didn't click, it's always great learning something new from my peers.

      Reading my feedbacks has been so awesome. They are super reassuring and help give me more confidence on my own abilities which is great when learning something new and daunting. The actionable-ness really helps me get an idea of where to focus my efforts and become more well rounded, whether it be related to programming concepts, or even just socially and driving/navigating better.
