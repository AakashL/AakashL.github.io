      Believe it or not, the e-commerce industry has lost over $3.5 billion in losses in year 2012 alone! <br>
      As more and more businesses start having an online presence, the number of targets for frauders to attack increases. Businesses of any size are open target for online fraud, but solutions do exists to help businesses determine whether or not a payment may be fraudulent. By catching fraudsters before they strike, businesses can increase their bottom line and save lots of potentially lost dollars.<br>
      Luckily, there are various fraud detection systems which exist to help companies weed out and gauge to see if a particular customer or order is fraudulent. A common way these systems work is by identifying various characteristics about the customer such as IP geo-location, proxy detection, device fingerprint, etc. to determine whether or not a customer may be fraudulent. By using a mix of this information, as well as cross-checking between prior cases in their database, fraud detection systems either catch or give a potential risk score to a customer. <br>
      Having a solid fraud detection method or system is key for any sized e-commerce store and can save a company lost time & especially lost dollars.
