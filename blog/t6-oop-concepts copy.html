      <h1>Variable Scope in Ruby</h1>
      <h4>September 4, 2015</h4>
  <section>
      
    <p>
      In programming a variable's scope refers to in which parts of the program the variable's value is accessible. Now that we've covered classes, we've seen all of the difference scopes of variables.

      In Ruby there are four different variable scopes, and each type is declared differently according to the formatting below:

      <table border = "1">
        <tr>
         <td> <b>Name Begins With</b> </td>
         <td> <b>Scope</b> </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
         <td> $ </td>
         <td> Global </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
         <td> @ </td>
         <td> Instance </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
         <td> [a-z] or _ </td>
         <td> Local </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
         <td> [A-Z] </td>
         <td>  Constant </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
         <td> @@ /td>
         <td>  Class </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    </p>

    <h2> Usage Examples </h2>

    <h3> Local Variables </h3>
    <p> Local variables are locally reference-able within the construct they were created in. An example of this is inside and outside methods. Local variables defined inside a method cannot be modified or read outside the method, and the reverse for local variables defined outside of a method. </p>

    <h3> Global Variables </h3>
    <p>
      Global variables are accessible anywhere within the program. On top of this, they are also modifiable from anywhere within the program too. w3schools: "You can set it anywhere, you can get it anywhere".
    </p>

    <h3> Instance Variables </h3>
    <p>
      Instance variables are local to specific instances of an object. Each instance of a particular object can have it's own value for an instance variable defined in that class.
    </p>

    <h3> Class Variables </h3>
    <p>
      Unlike instance variables, a class variable is shared amongst all instances of a particular class. If one object in the class changes the value of a class variable, it's changed for all instances of the class.
