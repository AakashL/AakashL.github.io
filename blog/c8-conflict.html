  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h4>September 20, 2015</h4>
  <section>
      
    <p>Having pets is great, and having a roommate with a pet is great too, but it's when the pet isn't tended to the best that problems arise. During my college years I lived with three good friends and our beloved cat which was owned by "E". 
    <br><br>
    At one point during the school year kitty's litter box started to be taken out less often, and started to stink up the place! At first we kindly reminded "E" to keep a closer eye on the poopoo levels, which worked for a while, but eventually the problem arose again. I felt like our shared living space wasn't being respected and the thoughts guests may have about the issue. 
    <br><br>
    At one point the conflict got as far as one roommate leaving a bag of kitty poopoo on "E"'s desk, hoping to convey the message stronger than just words. Although "E" got the hint after this, and handled the situation maturely, looking back it probably wasn't the best idea to take it to that level. Instead, better conveying how we felt about the issue, and how it was effecting us would have probably done the trick. I've found it's rarely a good idea to move a conflict from verbal to psychical (even if it's just small passive aggressive actions) and simply taking the time to talk it out and see eye to eye leads to a cleaner resolution without any sour feelings.
