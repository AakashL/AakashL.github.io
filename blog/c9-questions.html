  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h4>September 27, 2015</h4>
  <section>
      
    <p>Having spent a lot of times on forums, both leaching and contributing, I've learned that formulating a solid, detailed question is key to getting the help and support you need. Often times the initial question or thought that pops into our head is just a piece of the puzzle required for a solid solution. Below is a list of some things everyone should keep in mind when asking a question. 
    <br><br>
    <h2><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=are+javascript+strings+arrays">Google it!</a></h2>
    
    <p>There are A LOT of people on the web, chances are someone else may have already asked the question you have, you just have to find the answer. Remember, no one likes answering a question thats been answered a million times before, make sure to search first, and <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/11/24/google-search-infographic/">learn how to use Google effectively</a>.
    <br><br>

     <h2>Be Specific</h2>
    
    <p>More details about your specific issue will only help others better assist you. It's always important to include specifics such as version numbers, showing your actual code, etc. The problem you have may be specific to any number of variables regarding your setup.
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Show that you tried</h2>

    <p>Make sure to make an effort first! Explain what you've tried so far & what you've found in your searching. This will help people rule out what fixes may or may not help, and make it easier to give you a hand. 
    </p>
