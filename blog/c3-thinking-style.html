      The learning style which fit me the most was AS, with CR ans AR tying for second place. I've found that being able to review some examples of the concepts I'm going to use beforehand help give me a more clear picture of what direction to go in. I'm also a fan of trial and error and this week of assignments was very helpful for that. Using IRB, puts in my code, and the solution.rb files using trial and error on the exercises helped narrow down what sorts of tweaks to made in my code. 
      Time monitoring techniques , time boxing and mindfulness in particular, have proven to be very useful in helping me stay on track and better adjust my habits.
